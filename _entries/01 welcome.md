This site is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource center for information about arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the head and neck.

When I was diagnosed with my AVM in 2004, it was nearly impossible to find information about AVMs outside the brain. Even now, it can be hard to find reliable, vetted information about facial AVMs, so my goal with this website is to change that.

You can use the menu on the left to navigate to a specific section, or just scroll down. Since this is a one-page site, you can also use "ctrl + f" or "apple + f" to search for a specific word.

Thanks for visiting, and let me know what you think!
