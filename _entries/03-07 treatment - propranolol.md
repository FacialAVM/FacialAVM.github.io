Propranolol is a beta blocker most commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure - it is taken orally in the form of a tablet, extended-release capsule, or liquid (<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682607.html">source</a>).

In 2014, a formulation of this medication was approved by the FDA and made available for children and infants with another kind of vascular anomaly (hemangioma) (<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140317005904/en#.Uz1ZjvldVFY">source</a>). There is evidence that treatment with propranalol can decrease the size of hemangiomas, so it is sometimes prescribed to treat AVMs.
