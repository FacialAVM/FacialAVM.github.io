This site is intended to serve as a stable resource center for information about arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the head and neck.

When I was diagnosed with my AVM in 2004, it was nearly impossible to find information about AVMs outside the brain. Even now, it can be hard to find reliable, vetted information about facial AVMs, so my goal with this website is to change that.

It's not the prettiest website right now but that will change in the future as I have time and energy. Use the menu on the left to navigate to a specific section, or just scroll down.

Thanks for visiting, and let me know what you think!
