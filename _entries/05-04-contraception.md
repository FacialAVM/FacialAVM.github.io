You may have heard that estrogen-free hormonal birth control (such as the mini-pill, Depo-Provera, hormonal IUDs, or contraceptive implant) are safe for AVMs. This is not the case. According to Dr. James Suen, an AVM expert and researcher, hormonal birth control of any kind can cause the AVM to grow faster. Research at his lab "has shown that AVMs have Progesterone receptors and if you take any progesterone hormones, It can make the AVM grow faster. Any contraceptive without progesterone is ok."

Since pregnancy itself can make AVMs grow faster, a reliable form of contraception is essential (pregnancy with an AVM is possible but dangerous). Reversible non-hormonal birth control would be the copper IUD. You might also consider more permanent options. Speak with your OB/GYN for help determining which form of contraception is right for you.

Note: I do not know of a hormonal option that does not contain progesterone, but if you know of an estrogen-only option please let me know at [info@facialavm.com](info@facialavm.com)
