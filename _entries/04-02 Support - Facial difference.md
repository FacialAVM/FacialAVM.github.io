Many people with facial AVMs will have the experience of looking different from others.

<a href="http://www.aboutface.ca/">AboutFace</a> offers a huge range of services and resources around facial difference. Their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AboutFaceInternational/">Facebook page</a> is very active and wonderful -- I actually set up notifications so that I see everything they post. They offer:
* Monthly toll-free conference calls for adults and parents.
* Frequent social events and meetups (based in Ontario, Canada)
* Camp Trailblazers -- camps, retreats, and leadership programs for children, teens, and adults with facial difference
* Printed and digital resources for classrooms, families, healthcare providers, and individuals with facial differences.
* A college scholarship program (Canadian students only)

<a href="https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/Home">Changing Faces</a> is a UK-based organization. They offer support and resources to adults, children, and healthcare providers, including:
* An amazing set of <a href="https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/Supporting-You/Self-help-guides">Self-Help Guides</a>
* Emotional and vocational support
* Opportunities to share your story with a wide audience
